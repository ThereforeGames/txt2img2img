    """This function returns a Laplacian matrix with all weights equal to one.

    Parameters
    ------------
    image: numpy.ndarray
        Image with shape :math:`h\\times w \\times 3`
    radius: int
        Radius of local window size, defaults to 1, i.e. only adjacent pixels are considered.
       The size of the local window is given as :math:`(2 r + 1)^2`, where :math:`r` denotes         the radius. A larger radius might lead to violated color line constraints, but also
       favors further propagation of information within the image.

    Returns
